I'm a data science graduate student and GIS professional at Indiana University, experienced in Python and R programming. I am confident in my skills in statistical analysis, data wrangling, and data visualization, and I am growing in my knowledge of machine learning techniques and distributed computing. Feel free to reach out for collaboration!
